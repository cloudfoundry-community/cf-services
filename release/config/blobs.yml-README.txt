TODO: Reduce coupling with cloudfoundry/shared-release-packages by:

 o removing blobs.yml from source control with a .gitignore;

 o putting service-specific blobs in a new file (called
   "services-blobs.yml" for example); and

 o putting something like this in ../update to dynamically
   read the shared blobs from shared/config/blobs.yml:
     cat config/services-blobs.yml > config/blobs.yml
     grep -v -e --- shared/config/blobs.yml >> config/blobs.yml

Unfortunately, this is blocked by
https://github.com/cloudfoundry/shared-release-packages/issues/1.
