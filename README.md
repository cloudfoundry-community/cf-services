cf-services
====

This repo is an attempt to stabilize Cloud Foundry data services
(MySQL, MongoDB, etc).  The service code in the
cloudfoundry/{cf-release, vcap-services, cf-services-contrib,
cf-services-release} is stale/obsolete/dysfunctional in various ways.

Note that this repo contains both [source](src) and the corresponding
[Bosh jobs and packages](release).
